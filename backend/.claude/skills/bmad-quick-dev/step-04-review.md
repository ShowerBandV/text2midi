# Step 4: Review

## RULES

- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`
- Review subagents get NO conversation context.
- All review subagents must run at the same model capability as the current session.

## INSTRUCTIONS

Change `{spec_file}` status to `in-review` in the frontmatter before continuing.

### Construct Diff

Read `{baseline_commit}` from `{spec_file}` frontmatter. If `{baseline_commit}` is missing or `NO_VCS`, use best effort to determine what changed. Otherwise, construct `{diff_output}` covering all changes â€?tracked and untracked â€?since `{baseline_commit}`.

Do NOT `git add` anything â€?this is read-only inspection.

### Review

Launch three subagents without conversation context. If no sub-agents are available, generate three review prompt files in `{implementation_artifacts}` â€?one per reviewer role below â€?and HALT. Ask the human to run each in a separate session (ideally a different LLM) and paste back the findings.

- **Blind hunter** â€?receives `{diff_output}` only. No spec, no context docs, no project access. Invoke via the `bmad-review-adversarial-general` skill.
- **Edge case hunter** â€?receives `{diff_output}` and read access to the project. Invoke via the `bmad-review-edge-case-hunter` skill.
- **Acceptance auditor** â€?receives `{diff_output}`, `{spec_file}`, and read access to the project. Must also read the docs listed in `{spec_file}` frontmatter `context`. Checks for violations of acceptance criteria, rules, and principles from the spec and context docs.

### Classify

1. Deduplicate all review findings.
2. Classify each finding. The first three categories are **this story's problem** â€?caused or exposed by the current change. The last two are **not this story's problem**.
   - **intent_gap** â€?caused by the change; cannot be resolved from the spec because the captured intent is incomplete. Do not infer intent unless there is exactly one possible reading.
   - **bad_spec** â€?caused by the change, including direct deviations from spec. The spec should have been clear enough to prevent it. When in doubt between bad_spec and patch, prefer bad_spec â€?a spec-level fix is more likely to produce coherent code.
   - **patch** â€?caused by the change; trivially fixable without human input. Just part of the diff.
   - **defer** â€?pre-existing issue not caused by this story, surfaced incidentally by the review. Collect for later focused attention.
   - **reject** â€?noise. Drop silently. When unsure between defer and reject, prefer reject â€?only defer findings you are confident are real.
3. Process findings in cascading order. If intent_gap or bad_spec findings exist, they trigger a loopback â€?lower findings are moot since code will be re-derived. If neither exists, process patch and defer normally. Increment `{specLoopIteration}` on each loopback. If it exceeds 5, HALT and escalate to the human.
   - **intent_gap** â€?Root cause is inside `<frozen-after-approval>`. Revert code changes. Loop back to the human to resolve. Once resolved, read fully and follow `./step-02-plan.md` to re-run steps 2â€?.
   - **bad_spec** â€?Root cause is outside `<frozen-after-approval>`. Before reverting code: extract KEEP instructions for positive preservation (what worked well and must survive re-derivation). Revert code changes. Read the `## Spec Change Log` in `{spec_file}` and strictly respect all logged constraints when amending the non-frozen sections that contain the root cause. Append a new change-log entry recording: the triggering finding, what was amended, the known-bad state avoided, and the KEEP instructions. Read fully and follow `./step-03-implement.md` to re-derive the code, then this step will run again.
   - **patch** â€?Auto-fix. These are the only findings that survive loopbacks.
   - **defer** â€?Append to `{deferred_work_file}`.
   - **reject** â€?Drop silently.
